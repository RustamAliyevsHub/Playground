/*
For the Marbles game, the Front Man needs you to discover who Player 456's closest companion is. 
First, find the player who has interacted with Player 456 the most frequently in daily activities. 
Then, confirm this player is still alive and return a row with both players' first names, and the number of interactions they've had.
