/*
The Front Man needs to analyze and rank the teams before the Tug of War game begins. For each team that has exactly 10 players, calculate their average player age. 
Additionally, categorize the teams based on their average player age into three age groups:

'Fit': Average age < 40
'Grizzled': Average age between 40 and 50 (inclusive)
'Elderly': Average age > 50

Show the team_id, average age, age group, and rank the teams based on their average player age (highest average age = rank 1).

SELECT 
    team_id,
    AVG(age) AS avg_team_age,
    CASE 
    WHEN AVG(age) < 40 THEN 'Fit'
    WHEN AVG(age) BETWEEN 40 AND 50 THEN 'Grizzled'
    ELSE 'Elderly'
END AS age_group,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(age) DESC) AS age_rank

WHERE status = 'alive' 
AND team_id IS NOT NULL
