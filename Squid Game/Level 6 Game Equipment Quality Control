The guards are investigating equipment durability across different game types, as some equipment has been breaking prematurely.
Determine the game type with the highest number of equipment failures and identify the supplier responsible for the most failures within that game type. 
Finally, calculate the average lifespan until first failure, in whole years (using 365.2425 days per year), of all failed equipment supplied by this supplier for the most faulty game type.
